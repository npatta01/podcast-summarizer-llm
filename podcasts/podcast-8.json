    "episode_transcript": " Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crest podcast. I'm Crystal. I'm Jisoo. And I'm Lisa. So the last time Lisa was on the podcast with us was actually a long, long time ago, sub 100 episodes. So it was way back, episode 32, adulting 101. And in that episode, we talked about living with your significant other. And at the time, Lisa, you were living with your boyfriend at the time, along with your sister and her, was it husband or boyfriend? At that time, they were probably engaged. Okay. And then now, what is it like two or three years later, Lisa is married, freshly married, freshly walked off the aisle. A lot has happened in the last few years. Which is really crazy to think about. So we've invited Lisa on to talk more about the wedding planning process and, you know, just more adulting stuff. But before we get into the topic, we have a Gen Z Word of the Week. This one is actually brought to you by Jisoo. She thought of this word and the word, it's a very funny one. It's gyat. So it's spelled G-Y-A-T. Basically, the root of it is from the phrase, goddamn. And people have kind of evolved it into like, goddamn, like that's how they're emphasizing it. And so it's become spelled out as G-Y-A-T. And the way I've seen it used is most commonly, it's like a comment on someone's ass, for lack of a better word. So yeah, they'd be like, oh, goddamn, like that ass or whatever. The way you say it is so funny. I'm like so uncomfortable. I know. It's so cute. I actually have a little bit of a funny story with this one. And it's actually why I even brought it up to Crystal in the first place. But I pride myself as a Gen Zologist and, you know, keeping up with the new terms and whatnot. But the other day I was on TikTok. It was a TikTok of a girl and she was like, oh, you know, I know I have a flat ass, but today my ass looks really good. It looks like I have a huge booty. So like everyone hyped me up in the comments or whatever. And then the comment said like, oh, I get to go or you get to get your act together or something like that. And I was like, what are they talking about? Like, are they just clowning her and saying like, oh, you're wrong. You don't have like a nice ass or whatever. And then I looked it up. There was some sort of old definition that said get your act together is what G-Y-A-T is. But James on the side was like, oh, it actually just means like booty. Like, it's just like a generic term for like someone with a nice ass or something. And they're probably just coding it into like a sentence or whatever. So I was schooled a little bit by James. But yeah. Oh my gosh. I'm like Googling it now because I've never heard of this before. I think it's like relatively new, I would say. I've seen it become more and more used in like the recent months. But if like I were to reach into my mind, I don't think I saw it that much as early as like last year. So I think it's like a pretty fresh off the press gen Z word. I guess I've heard like the phrase being spoken like, yeah, damn, I've definitely heard people say goddamn like that. Yeah. Yeah. Just never knew that you could type it out G-Y-A-T. Yeah. And I guess like it sounds like the way they've truncated it is that you could just say like G-Y-A-T now and then that in itself just means like ass or like yo that ass or whatever. I've seen some funny TikToks though. So like I play Valorant, which is a first person shooter game. And then we have different like agents that we play characters that you play. And so when people like die, their bodies are shown on the ground wherever they died. And it's really funny because sometimes the like position that they're just randomly like flung onto the ground, their ass is like up. And so there's like so many clips of people they're like playing the game super serious locked in and then they see the like the fucking dead body and they're just like a big round butt in their face. And they're like, oh my god, like how can I keep playing this game when there's like ass in my face? And so for those when there's always like comments that are saying like, oh god damn or like yeah. My husband also plays Valorant. So now I'm going to watch and see if I can see those booties come up. Dude, but this one is so weird because I feel like it's not as easy to say. I feel like if you don't say it with that emphasis of like, yeah, then it's not as like cool or like not as fluid sounding. So I can imagine it being more of like a typed out word, more something that you say if you're like really in the moment, you're going to full send the delivery of the word. That's such a good point. I feel like I don't have the true like passion and emphasis to say it properly. So we've been saying it all like this these past couple of minutes and I'm like so uncomfortable trying to spit this word out. Well, I guess big booties aside, let's kind of jump into the topic today. So as we mentioned earlier, Lisa has recently gotten married to her then boyfriend now husband. And we wanted to get her on the podcast to talk about planning her own wedding and just walk through the whole marriage and wedding planning process in general. Let's start with the proposal story. So Lisa, tell us how your man's proposed to you. Prior to maybe like even a year before the proposal, or maybe like six months before, like we had talked about getting married and getting engaged and all that stuff. So none of it was a surprise. And honestly, we're both so bad with surprises. Like for Christmas, we always tell each other like we're going to keep each other's presents a surprise. And then usually a few days after we buy it, we're like, okay, I'm just going to tell you when I got you. So like we're just terrible with surprises. But like on top of that, we know, we figured like marriage is a big thing. I definitely don't want it to be like a surprise. So we had talked about it. And we actually designed a ring together. So then I had known after the ring was finished, I like went with him to pick it up. And like we put it on my finger to make sure it all fit. And then afterwards, after we confirmed that like everything with the ring was all good, he took it from me, and he hid it somewhere in the house. And he was like, okay, now you can't see the ring anymore. But because I knew he had it, and was somewhere in the house, like literally, every week, I'm like, when are you gonna propose? I want my ring. Like I know it's somewhere in here. Like what is it happening? So I kept pushing him. He's like, calm down, I have a plan. I'm like, do you really have a plan? Like, are you actually thinking about this right now? And so I think because I kept pressuring him, I kind of probably forced him to like pick a date. I'm like, this weekend is really nice. And then he was like, okay, fine. Do you want to go somewhere this weekend? And I had always told him that like, I want the proposal to be not at home, but I want it to be just the two of us. And so like, we didn't have to like worry about like coordinating with friends or anything like that. And so we decided to go to Berkeley, which is where we met at UC Berkeley. He took me to one of the hiking trails that they have there, which was kind of our first date. And so we're on the trail, it's kind of secluded, not too many people are walking by. And so it's kind of perfect. But you know, there are some people who are hiking. It's funny, because he's trying to do the let me pretend to tie my shoe and like get down on one knee. I feel like he was like about to propose a few times and we hear footsteps coming from behind us. And we're like, oh, there's someone here. And so we quickly get up. He gets up and like, we keep hiking. And then we found like a really nice area with a view. You know, thankfully, there was no one around. And so he just yeah, got down on one knee, gave a little spiel. And then yeah, that was pretty much it. And then we came back down, we got some pizza and had a little picnic. I love that you're like, oh, dude, the weather is great. I already checked it. Like, let's do something. And he was like, okay, yeah. I think because usually between the two of us, I'm the planner. So I'm the one who's normally like, hey, let's go somewhere. Let's do this. And let's do that. And so like me waiting for him to plan this, especially because I knew we already had the ring and I just kind of wanted it. I was too impatient, but it's okay. And then we ended up having like an engagement dinner a month later because he was like, you know, I actually booked this restaurant because I was planning to propose to you here or like on this day. He's like, you rushed me. And so I had to give you the ring a month before. And he couldn't like move the date. But you know, that's okay. Dude, he should have just reproposed. You're like, when's the next reservation we have? I love that though. And I think it's so funny where, you know, in movies, like they always say like, oh, engagements are a surprise. And like, you don't know when it's happening and blah, blah, blah. But to me, I'm also someone who doesn't like surprises. And I'm also bad at surprises as well. And I feel like the no surprise part could be just as romantic. And for someone like me who prefers not a huge surprise, it's even more romantic sometimes. Because my issue during the proposal or like, I guess the more accurate term is like waiting for the proposal was the agony of like, do I have to dress up tomorrow? Or like, when do I need an outfit by or like, you know, do I have to put on a full face of makeup this morning? Like that kind of thing. And this might be kind of like a Korean thing or I don't know, maybe it's just a female thing in general. But when I eat a lot the night before or it's late, then my face swells really bad the next morning. I would keep checking with him during like dinner time on like Friday nights, especially like, oh, should I eat a small amount today? Like, should I like skip dinner today? Or should I eat like a lot of meat? And at that point, I'm like, just tell me like, just tell me which weekend it is. You're like, what's the meal plan for this weekend? Yeah, exactly. That's funny. But I totally agree. I think I would fall into a similar category as you all where I would prefer the concept of the proposal and like taking your relationship to the next step towards marriage to not be a surprise. Because I feel like if it's a surprise, you never know like what if someone says no, right? So always best to have like talked about it before so that even if the proposal itself will be a surprise, at least like both parties are on the same page about marriage itself. Yeah, I definitely agree with that. I feel like in the movies, yeah, they romanticize the whole surprise thing. But I'm like, no, I think both people need to be on the same page and should have already talked about it beforehand. For sure. For sure. I know some people prefer it this way. And I think this way is also fine. But for me, personally, I don't want to roll the dice on like, oh, well, you know exactly what kind of ring I want. Or sometimes there's bigger things to have like, oh, financially, what's our budget? And like, you know, what are these big purchases we're gonna have to do later? Do I really want to drop 70k on a ring or something if I have a big purchase later or things like that, depending on your plans and goals. So I think all of these conversations are definitely worth having at least once or twice with your partner. Yeah, I guess it's like finding the right balance of romantic and like reasonable, logical. So then how soon after the proposal did you guys start to plan for your wedding? We got engaged in end of April, beginning of May, I think like the last day of April of 2022. I do think we started looking at venues at the very least just because we wanted to be able to like lock down a date if you know, there was a very specific date we wanted and if they were starting to fill up quick. I do also feel like when we got engaged, I kept hearing a lot about like some of the folks who had postponed their wedding during the pandemic were starting to get married again. And so there was a lot of spots filling up. They were like, you have to reserve some of your vendors really quickly. So at the very least, we wanted to lock down the date and the venue. So I would say in June ish, we started taking a look and like touring some venues. We you know, kind of casually would Google like, we knew we wanted to get married in the Bay Area. So you know, best wedding venues in the Bay and just kind of looking through and taking a list of the things that caught our mind. And it kind of also helped us like in the very beginning just to stay vague and like, okay, what kind of vibe are we going for? Like a hotel? Is it like an outdoorsy vibe? Once we were kind of able to compile a list of the styles that we wanted, then I think we reached out to a few to see if we can do a tour. What you mentioned about budget also comes into play, right? Like how much do we actually want to spend on a venue? And so I don't think we got super specific about like, what is our like absolute limit that we can't go over, but it's kind of do we want to pay 30k for this really beautiful venue? Or will should we save a little bit and go for like something, you know, there's some buildings that are owned by the government or something like that that's or the city that's a little bit cheaper and still beautiful. And so just kind of going between the pros and cons of both. That's the main stuff. But everything else like the real like substance of the wedding, we probably didn't get to until four months before the wedding or so. Yeah, so just the big vendors that we booked the venue and the photographers were the big ones. That's a good point, too. I think there was like a huge just wave of catch up weddings, if you will, like you mentioned, just like so many got delayed or canceled because of COVID. I think I saw someone had a wedding recently that was two or three years delayed because of COVID. And they just like never got around to it. So yeah, I feel like even now, there's probably still some like, COVID stragglers of trying to get their wedding in because those first couple years were I imagined to be super hectic. Yeah, I always think it's really interesting to see how different couples handle wedding planning after their proposal. So I know some people like to have longer engagements. That way you have more time to talk about the wedding or maybe save up for one or like really think about when you want to do it, things like that. But other couples kind of do it like on a more quicker timeline. And I think actually me and James were probably like the exact same timeline as you where we got engaged late November, and then our wedding is going to be December this year. So it's like also almost exactly a year so maybe 13 months. It's so funny because on like those Facebook groups for like, oh, Bay Area brides, you know, we discuss wedding stuff. Sometimes there will be brides there that are like, Oh, I'm a 2025 bride, like how early should I be looking at venues? And I'm like, Oh, shit, am I doing things too late? But you know, people just have different expectations and goals for their wedding. So it's kind of like to their own. I think it also depending on the venue, like I know when my sister got married, she had a very specific venue in mind in Berkeley Hills, where she and her husband used to run and you know, hike a lot. And I had heard that because that place is pretty cheap, because I think it might be owned by the city. And it's like super beautiful there. And so I had heard that they book up, I think they only open maybe a year in advance for reservation, but it books up very quickly. So I remember she was like, she had a specific date in mind. So then a year before, she had immediately kind of called or email to make sure that she can schedule a spot. So I think depending on how, if you know exactly where you want, I guess some people do need to plan a little bit further ahead. That's true. Wait, I need a rewind of it. You're in like Bay Area bride Facebook groups? Dude, I have to be I was like, how does everyone know exactly what they want? And it's like the craziest shit too. Like, I just met with a florist a couple weeks ago, and she was fantastic, like knew her stuff. She's like showing us pictures and she was like, so what leaves do you guys prefer? And I was like, leaves, I thought we were here to talk about flowers. And then I was like, I don't think we have a preference. And she was like, oh, you think that but you know, look at this picture A and picture B. And then I was looking at it and I was like, you're right, picture B, like those leaves are too fucking big. Like let's go with picture A leaves. So these like Facebook groups, I think really help me feel like less crazy a little bit. Did you join any Facebook groups, Lisa? I didn't, I actually didn't really see them until I think I was almost done planning the wedding. Thankfully, because my sister had gotten married a few years earlier, and one of my best friends also got married a few months before I did. I just bugged them a lot for like, did you have a list of things? Just send me your spreadsheets. And then I just kind of modified theirs with whatever was relevant to me. But you know, that was just my version of I guess, the Facebook group, I think it basically does the same thing of like, I don't know what to even start looking at someone just tell me, you know, send me a list of what you did and I will go from there. Yeah. That makes a lot of sense. Jisoo is going to be the first one to get married in like, most of your friend groups, right? So yeah, so it'll be my spreadsheets that I can just send them out. So Lisa, did you at any point look into getting a wedding planner? Because I know, I feel like the first moment you sit down and do a Google search, you're like, okay, this is a lot of stuff. Yeah, we considered it in the very beginning, especially because my sister originally started to plan her own wedding. And I think wedding as well and such as like other life thing, they just had a lot going on. And so they eventually ended up going with a wedding planner and she was like, that was totally worth the money. Definitely just saved them a lot of headache. So I think we would have considered it. But as we were venue touring, actually the venue that we ended up choosing provided a wedding coordinator for like a little extra fee. And so we were like, okay, it seems like the coordinator will kind of handle the main day and like coordinate with us about everything that needs to happen. And so that kind of seemed like the rest of the stuff for the wedding, we should be able to handle on our own. So we just kind of decided to pay a little extra to the venue for the coordinator and then did the rest ourselves. Yeah, that's awesome. I feel like that's one of the perks of going with like, kind of like all inclusive venue or just venues that offer a little bit more support so that you don't feel like you're just thrown into it all by yourself. I have a question about these wedding coordinators though. So since they're not like along the whole ride while you're planning the wedding itself, do you just like send a bunch of spreadsheets and info to them like right before the wedding and they're just like, holy shit, okay, I'll be ready by Sunday or whichever day. Thankfully, no, our coordinator started ramping up maybe four months before the wedding, which is also when I said that, you know, four months before is when we started getting really specific. And that's also because this is when the coordinator started ramping up and they send you the like questionnaire list in the spreadsheet, thankfully. So they're like, fill all this out, get it back to us by, you know, two months before the wedding. And so they give you a huge amount of time. And then that's when I was like, oh my gosh, okay, I have to figure out like, are we going to have musicians? Are we going to have DJs? Do they need tables? You know, and all these things, how many, what shape of tables do we want? What color linens do we want and all that. And so that also kind of helped us even though they're like dated the day of coordinator, they still need all that information to put the day together. And so it also kind of helped guide us of like, okay, these are the things that actually happened during a wedding day. And so this is what we need to figure out. Yeah. Yeah, that actually sounds really useful and makes a lot of sense. So they send you the checklist and you're like, okay, cool. I know what I need to do now. Yeah, basically. Yeah. So I'm actually at like the four month mark right now, like literally this week, and we're having our first like wedding planning appointment with our coordinator and our venue this Friday, I will get to experience everything Lisa's talking about. But one of the things that I found hilarious about my wedding planning journey was, you know, like we talked about, like not a lot of like my super close friends have gotten married yet. So I didn't have a lot of their resources to use like you did Lisa. And then my friend Chelsea, she like Googled a bunch of stuff as soon as I got engaged and sent me this humongous Excel or like a G sheets that she found online. It was like wedding all inclusive planner. And it's like, you just go through the entire G sheet with your partner to plan it. And it was like the most useful thing I've ever seen in my entire life. So I've been using that. And then once we signed with our venue, they gave us like a two inch binder with every detail that you would need. So like those two have in my bibles on planning. But the bad part is it's just like you still have to do everything. But at least you have one place where you can see all your assignments. Yeah, that makes sense. I remember when my sister was still going through with her wedding planner, she kind of thought that they would just handle everything for her. But I remember her telling me like they still wanted me to pick the color scheme. She's like, I don't know, I wish I could just tell them like pick a pretty one. I think there is still you know, work involved when you even if you have a wedding planner or coordinator. But I mean, they definitely do make that process a lot easier. Yeah, that sounds super helpful. I guess in my head, I just totally imagine people who plan their own weddings or just thrown into the abyss. No checklist, nothing. They're just like, okay, show up to the day before the wedding with a bunch of stuff in their hands and like in the trunk of their cars. And they're like, we're here to set up. Oh my god, that would be terrifying. Actually, I can't imagine doing that. Well, aside from the scary bits of wedding planning, so organizing everything and all that, what were some of the fun parts of wedding planning for you? Definitely the fun part was the wedding party, we each did like a kind of a bachelor, bachelorette party s type thing, except it wasn't anything like the movies. So no wild nights to speak of. But like on my side, it was my sister and my best friend who is a guy. And so I figured like the three of us hanging out by ourselves might be a little bit weird. And so we kind of decided to do like a triple date. And so with my sister and her husband, me and Derek, and then my friend Justin, and he is the friend that also recently got married. And so is he and his new wife. And so we just all went to Monterey and kind of hung out and went whale watching, got dinner. And so that was just like a really nice and pleasant day. So that was a lot of fun. I know Derek, his groomsmen were his high school friend and then a college friend. And so they took him out to like a spa day. And so it was like a whole like relaxing spa day with like a nice dinner. It was like a two day affair. And then the next day they went to the twice concert. So they rocked out to some K-pop. So I know he was, yeah, he couldn't stop talking about it for like days afterwards. And so I think they had a lot of fun. And all I could hear like he was only playing twice music. So that was definitely a lot of fun. I will also say the date of the wedding and the day before. So like the rehearsal and the rehearsal dinner and then the like getting ready part of the wedding was actually a lot of fun. I was originally a little bit stressed out because then it's like all coming together and you're like, oh my God, what if I forgot something? It's all going to fall apart. But then when like everyone is there and like they're all like there to celebrate you and everyone's really happy. I don't know, the vibe is just really nice. And so it kind of helped take the stress away and you just kind of, and then everyone's reminding you like, don't worry if something goes wrong, like, you know, it's bound to happen. Just enjoy yourself. And so and then, you know, everyone else is like, we'll take care of all the other things, right? Like you and Derek should just enjoy yourselves. And so having that support from our friends and family just kind of made the whole day so fun. Yeah, I feel like once people are actually there for the wedding day, everyone's so excited. Like they don't really care if the smallest thing goes wrong or like something falls apart. But now that I know even leaves matter, I feel like that would be such a great like just compliment to like, whoever's wedding you're going to you'd be like, wow, the leaves on these flowers are so nice. Dude, it's so funny because I mean, one Lisa on her wedding day was like the most graceful bride ever and did not seem stressed out at all. So I was like, oh, maybe on my wedding day, I also won't be stressed out. But I don't know. And the second thing is, I feel like Lisa is like, oh, you know, nothing was too hard. And I'm like, is it because she's done with her wedding now? And I'm just like fucking stressed because I'm like in the throes of wedding planning. Maybe that's probably true. That is very true. I will say we Derek and I tried to remind ourselves to stay a little bit low key during the wedding planning as well so that we weren't too stressed out. Thankfully, I didn't have like, neither of us had a dream wedding that we like needed to come, you know, the vision needed to come alive or anything like that. And so honestly, Derek, I think he was like, if you don't want a wedding, we don't have to have a wedding. So like, I think he would have been fine without one. But I'm like, no, we're going to have a wedding. And so he was like, okay, fine. Let's have a wedding. And so yeah, I think just kind of because none of us were trying to chase this dream, I think it made it a lot less stressful. There's like less additional pressure on yourselves. It's just like, all right, let's just get this wedding planned out and get there on that day. That's true. I think one of the things, so I mean, James are a little bit similar in that I also didn't grow up with like a Pinterest board of wedding stuff. And James obviously also did not. But I found it almost harder in a sense, because, you know, if you grew up thinking, oh, I want my wedding to look like this exactly, then when it comes down to like decision time, there's some sort of base that you're working off of. For us, it was kind of like, everything looks fine. So then how do you choose between four fine options? But now that I think about it, I think you are right in the sense that we still have the option to like choose stuff, but we're not bound to a specific idea or concept. So maybe I just need to like think about it more positively. Yeah, that is true. But I am kind of curious on your perspective on that. So when it came to like choosing your color theme, or the flowers, like I was talking about, or like dresses and whatnot, did it come pretty easily to you? Or did you kind of have to do some deliberating on it? I will say it didn't come that easily. I knew that I wanted it to be green, just because green was my favorite color. And so that part came easy. But then, and then the different shades of green, like, I don't know. Like, I know it doesn't want I don't want it to be like bright. So like, obviously nothing like neon or like anything that's like super bright in your face. But even in like the neutral, muted shades of green, there are so many. And I remember when my sister was trying to shop for her bridesmaids dress, and she was like, Okay, you have to tell me which green I'm like, I don't know, maybe like the olive one, or maybe the sage one. She was like, you have to pick one. I gotta buy a dress. They both look good. What do you think? And so yeah, I will agree that not having a very specific idea is kind of helpful and not helpful at the same time. I think ultimately, my sister ended up going to some dress store and got me some samples. And she was like, here are three samples of green, just pick one. And then I was still struggling. I'm like, they both look great. Until I was like, Okay, Derek, you have to pick one like be the typewriter. And so that's kind of how we ended up with it. But yeah, it definitely can be challenging if you didn't realize that there were so many different shades of a specific color that you wanted. And then like, once I chose green, like olive green, okay, I'm like, I don't I'm not that artistic. And so knowing what complimentary colors to match with green was also difficult. And so like, if you look at my Google search history, you'll probably see like olive green, wedding themes, like complimentary colors to olive green, and just like searching through lots of Pinterest boards and other mood boards to get an idea of what to do. Oh my god, that's so funny. Because sometimes I feel like when you buy stuff, just like normally out in the wild, you're like, damn, how come there's like not enough color options? And now for the like wedding planning, you're like, dude, when did when did we get all these colors? Oh my god, that's so true. That's so true. I know, at our wedding venue, they had like a whole binder of like the linen choices you had, and the different fabric types with each of the different colors. And I'm like putting the two shades together trying to and then like, you know, just a little square so that I'm like trying to imagine it as a whole table. Yeah, it's very hard. Oh my god. And you learn so many things too, that I feel like I'm like, is this actual useful knowledge out in the non wedding world? Like I remember the first time we went to go venue touring, they were like, oh, yeah, we have these chairs, I fucking forgot the name of the chairs already. And then we also have Chanel chairs, and we have these chairs, what chair do you want? And I was like, I don't know, like, can you show me a picture or something? And they were like, oh, I guess. And it was kind of that vibe of like, oh, you're going to be a bride, and you don't even know this yet. And I'm sure it wasn't as pointed. And it was like, you know, my lack of knowledge being projected onto them a little bit. But I do get that vibe sometimes where speaking with vendors, they will mostly address me and not James. And I wonder if there's some sort of pressure of like, oh, the bride should know exactly what they want for their wedding. And then the guy is just like, their assistant chef, like that kind of vibe, you know, did you ever experience anything like that, Lisa? Thankfully, I didn't notice anything that pointed. Thankfully, our venue, I don't know, the tour was very simple and brief. They're like, this is where we would have the ceremony. And they were just kind of giving us a tour as opposed to like asking us to pick between the two. They didn't have multiple chair options or anything like that. So thankfully, I didn't have to, we didn't have to worry about that. The only time that people would address me specifically was related to my dress, which I think made sense, because that would be the only one who knows about the dress. And so that was the only time I noticed that. But I wouldn't be surprised if people in the wedding industry had that sort of mindset of like, let's address the bride because they should know everything, every detail about the wedding. Oh my god, I would have loved if like they asked you about the chairs and then James just comes in. He's like, actually, we want this kind of chair and not those ones. James is like, I have a Pinterest of it that you can refer to. I guess that's the other aspect too is like, I'm sure, you know, these biases are picked up from their experience or whatnot. Or maybe it's just something that the industry needs to change in general for the future. But there is kind of a thing of like how supportive your partners throughout the wedding process. I think on one side, while it can be nice for someone to be like, oh, this is your day, like you pick everything on the other side, there's a lot of labor that goes into this, like we talked about. So how supportive was your husband in this whole process? Did you guys divide and conquer or did you guys tackle everything together? Like how did that all work for you guys? He was very supportive, but I would say I did probably 70 to 80% of the planning and that was partially intentional. Like I don't think I was like asking him and fighting with him for, you know, to pick up more of the slack and he was refusing to do so. It's more like I mentioned earlier, like it's in my nature to do more of the planning. And so I was just kind of excited to get started on the spreadsheets and kind of make a list of the tasks we had to do. And then some of the stuff specifically related to the groom stuff, like, you know, picking the gifts for the groomsmen and, you know, picking what, you know, whether they wanted to do bow ties or ties or, you know, whatever different types of suit color that they wanted to wear. So I definitely made sure that Derek knew that that was, you know, all of his territory when he was totally fine with, you know, obviously to pick up that part of the slack. I will say most of the bride side stuff and then the shared stuff I took the lead on, although I think when I was starting to get stressed because like, I don't know, if I didn't know what flowers I wanted or anything like that, then I would kind of be sitting here like, oh my gosh, there's so many options. I don't know what I want. And that's when I would be like, okay, Derek, you have to actually come look at this with me because I can't choose this by myself. So I will say when I started to get stressed and like overwhelmed is when we actually sat down and started planning it together. And that was really helpful. So I know you both are planners more on the planner side, but I actually am not a planner. So check back with me in however many years, I'll let you know how my wedding planning goes. Because there's two possibilities, right? One is my partner is not a planner and we're just both not planners. Or the other possibility would be my partner is a planner. And then what would happen there? I'm just imagining like a boy themed wedding, you know, like all the chairs like race cars or something. But yeah, I mean, I think that's great. And I know there's like a balance that works for every couple. And I totally kind of get the like, feeling stressed aspect of it. But I think one of the things that James and I had to kind of go through as like a challenge when we started planning this wedding was there's so many different tasks. And then I think even knowing what needs to be done is like half the battle almost like when you sit down to like choose things, that's like kind of the fun part. But keeping up with every single detail, making sure you don't forget one huge thing or one or another is I think really the hardest part. And it takes a lot of like maintenance and checking it whatnot. And I just remember once I was like, we don't have any plans on Sunday. So let's like sit down and do some wedding planning. And then James was like, Oh, what do we need to do? And I literally looked at him and I was like, like, I don't know what I can say to you, like all the research, like I've shared this spreadsheet with you, like you have the binder, like, do you want to like look at it? And then he got it, you know, like not much more had to be said. He was like, Okay, my bad, like, I know we need to do this, this and this. But I imagine a lot of couples kind of like, have that discussion sometime or later, maybe where you just kind of figure out what each person's roles and responsibilities are. He's like, Oh, shit. Yeah, I probably had that exact same conversation with Derek at some point. We had like a whole spreadsheet. And I was trying to write down like the list of tasks we needed to do. And then I had like a column for who was going to be responsible for it. And then like a column for kind of a due date, not like a real due date, but just to show like, hey, this should come like pretty quickly or like, oh, you can take a few months to decide this type of thing. I remember when we were kind of splitting up the tasks, I was trying to be nice. And so I was like, Okay, which part of the wedding are you interested in? And he said food and cakes. And I was like, Okay, sure. If that is your interest, then you take the food and cake and I will take, you know, not everything else, but you know, I'll take the majority of other stuff. And so then, you know, those were his tasks with his name next to it. And I had put, you know, some sort of arbitrary due date. And I was like, I think we should figure this out by like next week. And he was like, Okay, sure. And I could just see the due date coming on. And it's like just a few days away. And I know he has not done anything. And so just like, try to be nice and not too passive aggressive, but just like, Hey, have you taken a look at that list? Do you know what we're doing this weekend? We're wedding planning. So there was a little bit of nudging there. But for the most part, it worked out. It's so funny. I also have that same exact list and like format on our spreadsheet. So that's just hilarious, first of all. And I think the way you approached it of like, what are you interested in? Like that kind of thing is actually really interesting. Because I think what balance me and James have settled on at this point in our wedding planning is kind of similar to like play to our strengths and weaknesses where I can kind of do a more bird's eye view of like, this needs to be done by this time. I've since accepted that that's my role. And then James is really good at communicating with vendors and just being like the person to like email or phone call or like do those things. And that's actually something that I hate doing. So I was like, this is perfect. And what I once thought was like, Oh, why am I doing all of it was now just like, Oh, we're doing different things because we have different strengths. Dude, that's a good one. I also hate calling and emailing people. So the last thing that I want to kind of ask you about wedding planning is speeches. So I know speeches are a big part of wedding culture. And you and Derek have given amazing speeches at your wedding. And I know some of your wedding party members also did. So how was that whole process of like, one asking your friends to write speeches, and to writing your own speech and delivering it day of. So starting with the wedding party speeches. Yeah, we had let them know pretty early in advance just to give folks enough time to write if they happen to be planners. And so and I think it wasn't really a surprise to most people, I think, if they were part of the wedding party, I think they had expected to write a speech. And so thankfully, I don't think anyone was surprised. The only people that were possibly surprised were my parents. I think I was like, Okay, guys, you have to remember to write a speech for the wedding. They were like, Can we just reuse the speech from your sister's wedding? Please write a new speech. Like it can be similar. So they actually gave a speech for your sister, but they're still surprised that you asked them to give a speech for you. I think they were they were surprised about my sisters. But maybe they had forgotten about it. Maybe they wiped it from their memory. Just because I think they you know, had to they were trying to say it in English. And it wasn't you know, their most natural language. Even though they did a great job, honestly, my mom killed it with like a funny part. And then she took like the right amount of break to like really let them land. And so I'm like, Honestly, you guys are fine. But they were like, really another speech. I was like, Please don't recycle this speech. It's especially funny because for my sister's wedding, my mom wrote it in Korean, and I translated it for her. And so basically, I wrote her speech. And so I mean, like, because, you know, translating it into English, I, you know, added whatever made the most sense in English. So I was like, if you recycle that speech, you're saying what I wrote. That's not possible. So yeah, and so we had told everyone in advance, and I think it went really well. I think we tried to tell them like, maximum of three minutes, just so folks know that there's no pressure to like write a really long speech. And we really tried to emphasize like, shorter is fine short and sweet and concise is like, you know, the best way to go. And so hopefully, no one felt any pressure to, you know, write like a huge content for their speech. And honestly, I was really pleasantly surprised by all the speeches. They were so great. And so yeah, I think everyone did a great job. For my speech and Derek's speech to each other are vows. And so that was one of the tasks on the spreadsheet. I know, so funny, I had like set a due date for like a month before the wedding, as in like, okay, let's like, get that off of our plate early. And like, we both knew that it was on there. But I don't think either of us started really working on it until like maybe a week or two before the wedding. Just because like I tried and you know, like, and like, I'm not a natural writer. And so just like sitting there, and like trying to find the right theme and mood of like, I don't want it to be too cheesy. I wish it could be a little bit funny if possible. But I, you know, obviously don't want to like roast him. And so like finding the right balance between like, I want everyone to think like, oh, that's cute. And like, oh, that was kind of funny. While like sending the right message was pretty difficult. So I did a lot of googling of vow example. And like specifically like modern feminist vow examples and stuff like that, because I didn't want it to be too traditional and kind of cheesy or like really religious, because neither of us are that religious. And so it was some specific googling to make sure that the examples I was getting was the right vibe. And then once we did, I kind of decided that I just had to start writing. And so like just, you know, word dump, just put things on there and then kind of edit it as I go picking in the right stories. We both sent it to like each of our friends so they can proofread and then get a little bit of a vibe check of like if they were like, oh, this is kind of weird versus like, oh, that's really cute. And so I was like, please be brutally honest, like, don't just say it's cute, just because you know, you don't want to make me feel bad. And so yeah, I think that was both of our process. Oh, and we both made sure to set ourselves a time limit as well. Like, let's try to both stay within like, you know, the two minute mark or something like that, just so that not one of us has like a whole speech and the other one's like, oh, I love you. That would be so funny. Yeah, and then we definitely had our mutual friend check both of our speeches so that she could also double check that they were similar vibes. Wow, that's so smart. That's a really good idea, actually. Yeah, that's very smart how you approached it all. And don't count yourself out for writing because you wrote your mom's speech too. That's true. Thank you. What if your parents actually did recycle their old speech, but this time your sister translated it? I'm gonna have to go back and find their old speech. So how nervous would you say you were when you were doing your vows with your husband? Because it's a crowd of people kind of watching you guys. So were you nervous at all? Or were you just kind of in the moment? I was pretty nervous. I would say the vows were honestly the part of the wedding that I was most nervous about. Because I had mentioned during the proposal, my one requirement to him was that I wanted it in public because I wanted it at a pretty venue or a nice place, but I wanted it to be just us two. So I'm generally not one to have a huge crowd watch us and hear us talk about how much we love each other. So that was definitely pretty nerve wracking. And then it kind of felt like a public speaking type of moment. Because yeah, people are watching and like, obviously, there's like a really important moment in the wedding. And so they're listening very carefully. But I also tried to remember it like, you know, it's a wedding. Most people are going to like, first of all, they're not going to really remember it after they hear it probably. Even if some part of it was awkward, no one's going to say anything. So I tried to like, remember like, okay, like, we're the stars, they're not gonna like roast us about it afterwards. And then once I actually started saying the speech, I think I just kind of forgot about the crowd and was trying to, yeah, make sure to say the words and kind of look at him. And I will say I kind of choked up near the end as well. So yeah, it definitely got us in the moment. Nice. That's the best. When the bride and groom choke up and then everyone starts crying. Oh my god, dude, I'm just imagining because James is not a super emotional person, definitely not one to like tear up. So now I'm just imagining him fake choking up so that other people can choke for the entertainment value. Like inserts a voice crack. Actually this is unrelated to the speech, but I know so before the wedding, we did our first look. So like when I tap his shoulder and he turns around and sees me for the first time, I think there's a lot of pressure for him to cry and get really emotional. And Derek is also not the one, you know, the type of person who cries very easily. And he was saying that he normally cries for like sad things as opposed to happy things. And so he was like trying to warn me. He was like, I hope you're not expecting me to cry. I'm not going to cry. I don't want you to feel bad. I'm like, that's totally fine. Like, I don't care if you don't cry. I'm like any sort of genuine reaction would be fine. Like, you know, a smile, a laugh or, you know, whatever. So I was like, as long as it's a genuine reaction, I don't care if it's crying or not. So I definitely do feel like there might be some pressure for people to show certain types of emotion. But I think whatever comes naturally to use is probably the most genuine and beautiful. What actually made me kind of tear up at your wedding was one, when you first like walked down the aisle. And then two, when you guys were up there, your sister was tearing up and me and Jessica were just watching your sister turn around and wipe her tears. And me and Jessica in the car ride, because we had like lashes on and our makeup on and everything, the car ride to your venue, we were like, okay, don't cry today. No one cry today. And then I saw, you know, your sister turn around and wipe her tears. And I look over at Jessica, she's like bawling. I'm like tears down my face. Like, what have I done girl? Like stone faced tears. That's so funny. Oh my gosh. I will say I remember during my sister's wedding when I was also up there, I was also trying not to cry. And I remember it was kind of cold. So I'm like shivering and then like tearing up. And then I'm trying not to cry. And therefore I'm like snotting. So now I'm like trying not to snot. So I was like a whole like, oh my god, like no liquid please come out of my face. Oh god, that's so hard. Because you said it was cold too. Right. Yeah, exactly. So yeah, I definitely remember that. I'll have to remember to bring tissues for you. Did anything surprise you about your wedding day? I don't know if this should be surprising, but I think I was pleasantly surprised by how much fun I had. I think I was really nervous coming up to it that like, what if I mess up the vows or like what if one of the vendors don't show up, you know, all those different worries that I thought I might not be able to enjoy myself. But I think once the day started, you know, everyone says this, but it just went by so fast. And so, you know, it's like a whole jam packed schedule of like, okay, makeup starts at a certain time, everyone comes and meets together at the venue. And then also once everyone's there, everyone from the wedding party, all your friends and families gather, then you know, you're just having fun, you're just chatting with them. And so it just goes by so quickly. And then during the wedding, every moment was kind of, it's kind of weird, every moment was kind of a blur, but also like I remember them at the same time. So I feel like the whole time was a blur, but I can like still picture like, Oh, yeah, I remember when we were walking down the aisle and like all those parts. And so I think that was pretty surprising. That's the best surprise of all, because sometimes the surprise could be like, Oh, it was raining or like, you know, something happened or someone didn't show up. But the fact that the most surprising thing was how awesome and memorable your whole day was is really just awesome. Yeah, yeah. There was a moment where our so during the ceremony, because you can't have amplified sound at the venue, we hired these live musicians to play because otherwise the whole ceremony would be like completely silent as I like walk down the aisle because you couldn't play music. And so the live musicians were pretty important. And then I remember like 10 minutes before the wedding is supposed to start, our coordinator comes up and is like, you know, the live musicians aren't here yet. She's like, I'm trying to get to them. But I think I was just so like happy that I'm like, Okay, sure. Just like let us know when they're here. I'm like trying to know why I was just like, Okay, sure. You know, because it's like it is what it is. If they don't show up, what are we going to do? And thankfully they they came, they were just a little bit delayed. But I guess another surprise was how chill I was by a potential mishap. Wait, that's so funny. I'm just imagining your wedding coordinator like freaking the fuck out. She's like, Oh my god, are you sure it's okay? I'm gonna call them again, like 10 times. I could tell she was like trying to stay calm to not freak me out. But then she was like, Okay, like, they're not here yet. But you know, I'm emailing them and I'm calling them. And I'm like, Okay, that's fine. She's like, Okay, I'll let you know. She like shuffles away. Lisa's like the anti bridezilla dude. She's just like, Okay, whatever. Like, thanks for letting me know.
