Welcome to ABG, Asian Boss Girl, a podcast for the modern day Asian American woman. I'm Janet. And I'm Mel. So our conversations usually include the trio, you know, Janet, myself, and Helen. Today, we're going to change things up. So starting with today's episode, we're going to be diving deeper into our individual friendships within ABG. So for today's episode, we'll be diving into my friendship with Janet. And in future episodes, we'll be diving into Helen and Janet's friendship and then myself and Helen's friendship. And that's pretty much our trio. So today's a friendship episode. Yeah, we get a lot of questions actually from our listeners about adult friendships, specifically female friendships, right? Because I think there's always so much conversation around romantic relationships around your 20s and your 30s. But some of the most important relationships that you have are with your female friends. So we wanted to kind of explore that. And as Mel said, we're going to be talking about our relationship, particularly. And yeah, we're going to walk down memory lane, get into some, I don't know, topics that maybe we haven't talked about openly before. Ooh, okay. So maybe to kick things off, Janet, how would you describe our dynamic? How would I describe our dynamic? Well, I think there is a bit of an older younger sister dynamic. Yeah, I agree. Or maybe I feel like maybe it might be more like the way you might have with like a older cousin and a younger cousin, you know, because like the sister thing I feel like sometimes is like you would get maybe you feel more like, like I don't feel like I like reprimand you or feel like personally responsible for stuff, but it's more like I want to look out for you. And then if you're like struggling with something, I feel like obligate, not obligated, but I feel like this like internal need to like help you like alleviate your suffering or something. Yeah, that's such a Janet response. So for me, I definitely see you as like my older sister. I feel like as someone that never had an older sister, but always wanted one, you totally represent that. Yeah. I think when I think about our dynamic, it's very like when I say sisters, like the type of sisters that are really close, I can tell almost everything to you. You know, like I never had that dynamic. So I'm assuming that's what we have and assuming that a lot of other like sisters have that too. Yeah. I don't know if you and Patty have that or like Helen Annie, but like I think about that dynamic because I feel like I say we're close because I could talk to you for hours. Like I remember one time we drove to the Bay Area and we literally did not play like music or podcast. We just talked for five hours straight and I was like, oh wow, this is so nice. I also think that the reason why I also see as an older sister is because I do feel like actually maybe the cousin thing makes more sense, but I could go to you for things and not feel judged at all. So fun fact, I think I feel like I told you this before, but Janet's actually one of the few people that knows all my secrets. Oh, yeah. Like, you know, yeah. And it's like, or you're actually one of the first person I always tell something to. Like when I have a tea, when I got tea or like when something's going on in my life and I'm like, oh my God, like I don't know what to tell or I can't tell people. You're the first one. I think it's because you're so not judgmental, but you're also like kind of supportive at the same time. Like, I don't know, like it's very, it's very reassuring. So I would describe Janet as like the ultimate big sis. Yeah. But you're also fun. Not like you don't reprimand at all. You're always like, I'm gonna let you learn. And if things happen, I'll be here for you. I think that that's why I kind of went to cousins instead of sister, because like when I think about my sister, sometimes as the older sister, I would not tell her or like I know that she wouldn't tell me certain things because she wants to like protect me from like worrying. But with cousins, you're kind of just like, you share everything. That's true. That's true. But I think it's definitely the closeness of a sister for sure. Yeah. Oh, that was so nice. Yeah. I mean, like, so thinking about kind of our relationship now, we've only actually known each other for like, okay, I was gonna say only, but it's like seven, eight years. That's a long time. It's a long time, but it's not that long compared to some of the people that we've known now that we're in our thirties. That's true. For how close we feel, right? And how close we are. Do you remember the first time you met me and like, what was your impression of that? Oh my gosh. Has it been, I think I met you back in 2014. I don't know if you remember this. So I met Janet in 2014 in December. The reason why I remember this is because in December, our friend Eric Wang always has his ultimate Vegas trip. And that was a year I started working with Eric doing like YouTube touring and all that stuff. I happened to be in Vegas the same weekend y'all were. And I was with my friends and Eric's like, Hey Mel, why don't you join us for one night? And I was like, what? Like, and at the time I was very like young and like very excited and very like wanting to like make a good impression. Cause like I saw like Eric and Janet, all this, this, these big groups of people, this group of people, I was like so much older than me. And like, it means someone like idolize y'all. Cause like Wong Fu is part of the group. And I was like, I worked with them and I'm like, there's still that, that boundary, I guess. And so being invited, I was really intimidated. And it was my first time in like this like suite, like I was like, Oh, you guys aren't crammed in a little room. So I went, I met them at Cosmo and I was sitting there just kind of with my friend, like really awkward in the living room. And I didn't know what to do. Cause everyone's running around getting ready. And Janet and Henry, you guys approached me and were like, hi, like I'm Janet. Like, do you guys want anything to drink or eat? And I felt so like, Oh, that's so nice of her. Like she is so friendly and very kind. And that was my first impression of Janet. Like you approach me. So I, my memory of you actually goes back further than that. I think it might've either been the same year or a little bit before, but I remember actually seeing you for the first time on the set of David Choi's music video shoot. And I think we have told the story before, but I just, I distinctly remember it because it was, I was, I had lived in San Francisco for many years at this point and I just, I was coming back to LA and trying to kind of like find a new social group and everything. So I had kind of like tapped into Eric Wang again, and then also like with the Wong Fu guys and stuff. And so Eric had messaged me and he's like, Hey, at the time I think he was managing David Choi. He's like, Oh, I'm like helping this friend shoot a music video. We need some people you want to come down. It'll be in, it'll be in like downtown area and there's like food and drinks and stuff. I was like, okay. So I just like showed up not knowing what to expect or anything. I knew David, I knew Eric. I didn't know like anyone else. And then I remember seeing this like spunky, really like smiley girl walking around, kind of like floating, bouncing from like person to person. Like, you know, the way that you do when you're like on set and you're like, this is the schedule, but you're like, are you okay? Is this happening? And I remember seeing this such young little Mel with so much enthusiasm. You had your hair in like a messy bun and you were wearing, you were wearing, I think like this like speckled, like it's, it's like gray, but it's like, we know when it's like white and black dots, it was like a duster, not a duster. What do you call this? It's a sweater. It's like a, but the longer, the longer sweater and you had like a white shirt and then like black skinny jeans, like very LA creative. Oh really? Oh wow. Okay. Yeah. I mean, I worked a little bit in the advertising scene or just like, I think a lot of the, that was like kind of you, you dress in like minimalist, like neutrals and your hair in the messy bun. So, and I remember you floated to me and you were like, hi, my name is Melody and blah, blah, blah. And I was like, oh, this girl's so kind and she's so like bubbly. She has such good like energy. And then I don't know if I connected to that was the same Melody when I met you in Vegas, cause you probably looked dressed very differently. That's very true. You're Vegas, like going out. I was very much less close, not wearing a duster, but it's funny cause I remember that shoot distinctly cause I was still getting my footing in like work and like I was only 24. Baby. I was just, was trying to, I was getting started. I remember Janet because, I don't want to call him out, but one of the people on set thought you were really attractive. And he goes, oh, who's that? I was like, oh, you, and I was trying like, I'll see, build a connection. I was like, oh, you're interested in this girl. Let me talk to her and see. And so I talked to you too. I tried to be, but I kind of distinctly remember meeting you because I was like, oh, she's very attractive. Nice. So I remember that moment too. We've been friends for a really long time now. And I know we talk about this dynamic of being kind of this like younger sister, older sister. But you know, it's definitely evolved over time, especially I've noticed now that like, once you entered your thirties and then the more years we spent working in ABG together, I feel like our relationship has kind of like shifted a bit because you've really grown up. And you know, whereas in the past, I remember like you would come to me sometimes like crying or like Janet, I don't know. I feel this way. And you know, those conversations still happen. And I really appreciate it. I love kind of being a support system, but I feel like now some of the reverse has happened. Like just the other day we went out to like run some errands and like grab lunch. And I kind of just like opened up about things and you were so, I was like having a moment where, you know, when you're like watch the, you're like out of body and you kind of watch the conversation. I was like, oh my gosh, she's becoming kind of this like mentor in this conversation. Like, Hey, this is how, as your friend, this is how I see things. This is how I would do things. If I were you or like, this is what I'm looking out for you on, you know? And, and not only on our friendship level, but I feel like with ABG work as well, there have been a lot of moments where what we do is amazing and we're so grateful, but there are really hard moments. I found that like more and more in the last couple of years, especially like when Helen went on maternity leave, I would turn to you a lot, like I relied on you a lot and I needed you to be like that person sometimes who not only has like a business partner and as a work wife, kind of, but also as like a friend. So I feel like it's like you've grown up a lot and sometimes our dynamic now becomes like equal in some of those ways, if that makes sense. That is well, first of all, thank you for sharing that. I, it's processing. Wow. I don't know why I think maybe within our dynamic and our group, I always think I'm the baby. And so with hearing this, I'm just like, it's kind of like a reality. You're a very mature baby. Yeah, very mature baby, but it does, it's starting to set in like, I don't know, like I forgot I used to cry to you all the time. And like, I don't know. I have more things to share later about this dynamic too, but yeah, I forgot, I forgot a lot about our twenties, like the early moments of like feeling maybe afraid to speak up or a little bit, or just sharing things. I am a definitely an emotional person. Maybe now that I'm older, I am, I'm aware that emotional, but I could hone in on it a little bit more or have more of a reigns on it. I think I'm just like, I'm gonna just cry. I'm going to just run to Janet or I'm going to like do whatever. So thanks for observing that. I didn't realize that in myself too. Whoa. Okay. So obviously if you listen to podcast, you know, Jenner actually, we have different, but similar personalities have to be fun to explore, like our similarities. So Jay, what are some things that you find are common between both of us? I think there is definitely a similarity in our big sister energy because we are both the eldest in our families. Agreed. So Mel has a younger brother and I have a younger sister. I think your age difference is a little bit more. So I'm not as like, I'm only like three years older than my sister, but there's definitely moments and I don't, I can't, I'm like trying to think of an example, but in like group dynamics, where I can tell, you know, when you see another elder child and it's like, you guys have the same vibe. What's like an example that would demonstrate that? I think it's a little of protectiveness. I think that's what it is. And I don't want to say it like, I think with eldest child, I don't, maybe just between both of us have this trait, but we're a little bit more cautious with certain things because we want to make sure everything's okay. So we're not as like laissez-faire with certain things because I feel like I'm a little bit more like, I hover on certain moments because I get nervous because I am like that with my younger brother, maybe. Yeah. I think, I mean, as one example, it's like if we were to go out socially and we were in a group of people, I think we play kind of like the third parent or like the mom role a little bit because you're used to that, right? When you have a younger sibling to look after, it's like you're going to go and you're going to have fun, but you're going to be, you're going to, you have like the parent hat in the back of your head always like trying to make sure people are taken care of and stuff. And I think, yeah, like you're, it's just this natural like inbuilt thing that like I have to be responsible. Right. And yeah. Actually, you make up a good point. So an example I thought of is was when we went to DeJoy premiere, Amber Victoria, we couldn't find our team member and I was like freaking out. I was like, oh my God, where's everyone? I need everyone here at once. Yeah. I don't want to lose anyone, but that's just like the mindset I have to like, I don't know. You need to have like tabs on everyone. We're all my kids. Yeah, we're all my kids. Kind of mentality. I think another thing Jay and I have in common is we talk a lot about like mental health stuff. We were actually very open about going to therapy. I think we both, when I started going to therapy, I'd share with my sessions with you. I think we developed this openness of like, oh, what did you talk about today? And I know for some friends, it's like very taboo, like very private matters, which is totally understandable. But I think we had this relationship where it's like, oh, today I talked about this. I'm like, oh yeah, what'd you learn? Like I think with that element, we're not afraid to be vulnerable. And I think with through mental health, we also have similar interest in podcasts, like Jay Shetty or like we'll share certain like articles or like this, this, this video we watch. And I feel like we just have conversations about that. I think, yeah, when it comes to like self development or like, like ways, I don't know, approaches of journaling and different exercises like that, I think we, we are a little bit more just generally personally interested in those things and we'll seek those out and we'll share those with each other. And then yeah, on the mental health front, I feel like you very comfortably would come to me and say like, I'm like, I feel like anxious or something. And then I'm like, oh, I have felt that way as well. I've had these exact symptoms or like I had friends that experienced this exact thing. And that can be kind of challenging to talk openly about with like some of, I don't know, with like a lot of people, right? But there was like a natural openness for us, I think. Yeah. Yeah. One of the biggest things I think that unites me and you, I feel like this is actually the biggest theme probably and why we got so close is we were in the same, we were in the same periods in terms of dating. Like we were both on the lookout for our future partner and we're both on the dating ass, had the dating woes. And so we always could talk to each other about it. Like who am I talking to? Like, oh my gosh, you're going out tonight. Like I'm getting nervous and I feel like having a girlfriend in LA, because you're the only one I talked to about this that was also single. And I really talked to you about it. So I feel like that was our common factor. Like I know you're a little bit older than me, but I feel like in terms of like what we want and sort of like timeline in terms of dating, we're very like on the same page. Yeah. And we were definitely both dating, looking for a single partner or like our partner, life partner. Whereas like, I know there's like other women and myself included when I was in my twenties, I wasn't necessarily dating in that way, but I feel like even though there was the age difference, we had that common goal. And because I think we're also like kind of different, like we are able to reflect for each other to be a sounding word, to be like, okay, so this is what usually this means if this person does this or like, I think you need someone a little bit more like this way. Like we talked about for you, oh, I think you need, you know, maybe you should try dating someone who's a little bit more introverted. How would that work? And sometimes I'm like, maybe someone a little bit more like me. Like, and then you'd be like, I think you need someone a little bit more like this way or that. Like being in a similar situation of being a single female in LA, looking for a permanent partner and being Asian American puts a pretty like limited pool. It does. But I think with dating on a deeper level, I feel like sometimes like with a lot of our friends, like getting engaged, getting married, like on these kind of moving on with their life, it could be kind of lonely. And I think there are moments when we have each other, but like, oh, we still have each other though. Like it's not like we didn't feel so alone because you have a friend to call on. Another thing I want to say about dating that I just realized is I think that I didn't recognize that we had in common. And I think I was probably influenced by you was that our approach to dating too. Like I remember you were very like, I'm not here to waste time. I'm going to ask him certain things. Like you don't shy away from like, this is what I'm looking for. So I am in life on your date. And I think I kind of just like soaked that in probably my twenties because I'm always, I recognize within myself that I'm not the type to just have a fling and like, you know, even though it sounds a little fun, but I just never, that never was who I was, who I am. And I think watching you and like caring about your dates, I started doing that on my dates. Like, oh yeah, I told him like what I wanted in life. And like, I asked him really direct questions. And when I tell my friends back at home, they're like, what the fuck, Mel? You asked these things. I'm like, they're like, oh my God, I would never. I was like, why? But you just need to know what you want. But I feel like I got that from you. So that's a common thing. Like I became common because I learned that from you. Actually going back to the supporting each other while we're being single and like knowing that it gets lonely. I still remember from Valentine's day. Oh yeah. Oh my gosh. You came over and you were like, let's do a dinner. And we, and you like, or like, we kind of like co-hosted a dinner for our like single friends. Yeah. But that is true. Like a lot of moments in our friend groups or socially when it's like couples, Mel and I would be like, okay, this is my, my date for the night. Or like my, if we were going on like overnight trips, it's like couple in this room, couple in this room. Mel and I would look at each other and we're like, okay, we're, it's kind of like, we just know it's like we're each other's default, which is nice. We have an ongoing list. I have ongoing lists. I was like, here are all the hotel rooms. Janet and I have shared a room, shared a bed with. I do think all these moments have gotten us really close though. You know, so these are all the common stuff, but of course there's also very clear differences. The first one is our age. I guess. Yeah. Our age is, I mean like how, we're like seven years apart. Yeah. We're seven years apart. Seven years apart. Man. Yeah. But like I said, I think once you reach your thirties, that difference didn't feel so stark for some reason. Yeah. I agree. And in, in, in some ways I feel like, um, yeah, I don't know. I'm like, was I like you when I was 32? I think you were, I met you. No, I didn't. I think you might be the age that I was when we first met or like when we first started ABG, maybe girl. I don't know. But yeah, let's explore our differences. Okay. Let's see another, what's another difference that we have? Okay. Clear is personality. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think we could have like really like we have really good conversations, but I think overall in terms of personality, I will say I am leaning towards extroverted. I'm a little extra and like can be too much. Janet is not at all. I can be a little too little or a little. You're more introverted. You're more reserved. I'm definitely more reserved. Yeah. I also have called, I described you as you're very like refined and very like sophisticated and like put together. I'm want to be sometimes, but I just, I'm not that person. You know, I think, I think sometimes I can come off more like proper and polite. And I think you come off very like friendly and open and warm. I'm like improper. But yeah, there's definitely, I think a nice like dynamic of like, I don't know if you want to call Ian and Yong, but yeah, I agree. The matching. I think another thing that we always like kind of joke about is like our differences in like flavor and food preferences. Dude. We are kind of like night and day. Let's just say I wouldn't frequent the restaurant's Janet line. I think you, I'm like, I like heavily like salted food. You like not so salted food. But I think we make it work when we go to lunch. Yeah. Yeah. Cause like my sister and my dad are kind of similar where they like the more like garlic flavors and the, the soy sauces and like the spicy and like hot oil type things. And I'm much more of like, I kind of like mild flavors. I kind of like prefer things like a little bit a little bit more. I don't know. Like simple, simple. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Another difference, I will say we have a lot of very different interests. Yes, we do. Like I think I'm really, I don't want to say it this way, but I think it could be more basic. Like I love like pop culture. I like really like fashion and like kind of like girly things. And I could really lean into that a lot. I think Janet's you're really into like horoscopes and like also, I think I'm a little bit more alternative. Yeah. Like I do really love like astrology. I love contemporary art, like visiting museums. I kind of, I think you are like, you love like mainstream and media and keeping up with that. And I'm a little bit more like, I kind of like the little like indie stuff, right? Yes. Yes. Yes. But because you have the interest in like storytelling and media, I do find that like we will talk about a random film or a book and we can go off and like kind of analyze it together. Yes. We do that a lot. I think that's true. I feel like would you say you lean towards more like, is it nonfiction? Nonfiction. Yeah, I do usually. I used to. Okay. Yeah. Mel loves fiction. Yes. And I would lean a little bit more towards like nonfiction. Like I liked reading public stuff that people would say a little bit more self help or like spirituality or like business type books or economics and philosophy and stuff like that. And then you got me into fiction. Yeah. I'm into like, take me away to like Hogwarts or something. Like I want to be into some fantasy land. Another difference is I know that Mel can be quite competitive. Oh yeah. She likes to win or she likes to kind of like... Makes things fun. Yeah. Yeah. You definitely, you have, and you and Helen share that in common. I think she's also quite like, she likes competition. She's more than me. And I'm like the opposite. I don't, I don't know. I like really, it's not that like I shy away from it, but I'm not, I don't get like a high from like, from competition. I don't know. I think I'm more of like a, just like I like, I like for everyone to feel like not equal, but like a little bit of, I don't know. Janay is so nice. This is so true. I remember because there's a lot of times like our friends, like we get together, we play like bunch of like drinking games or like just games, like beer pong or whatever. Literally I'm just like, what gets me excited is like, I need to fricking win. And I want to win. Janay goes, Oh, let's just all have a good time. You're on that team. We're going to, let's just play. I'm like, no, no, no, no, no. But when you're on my team, I was like, Janay, we're going to like, we're going to do good. That's a very, that's a very good difference. Those are definitely, we find out some of the differences that we have. And yeah. And in a lot of ways we said we are like the opposite. Do you think if it were not for our friend group and if we were just like strangers, would we actually develop a friendship? Like, like if it wasn't for our group. I really wish you could answer this first, if I'll go. This is tough because I can see me and you getting along if you were like, we're in the same company together. Yeah. And not to say it this way, but I think when I, I noticed that at my, whenever I worked in corporate, I value the people heavily, but I've always made friends with people that I didn't expect sometimes. But those friendships to me have lasted and are so meaningful that I feel like I could see us like in a meeting and I make a small comment and then we could like start talking. And I would be the type to be like, oh yeah, how was your, like, I would ask you things. Cause I'm the type to impose myself on my coworkers, but that's how I become friendly, friendly, friendly and posing. That's how I become friends with them. So whether it's like a meeting or like a project, I could see that. But on the flip side, I feel like if we were like at a bar or like it depends on the setting, I don't think we would actually approach each other because I feel like at the bar settings, that's when I actually really gravitate towards very like outgoing extroverted extroverted, like really sassy people that I just kind of like click with. So I don't think it depends on the environment. I could see us if we were like at a house party and there were like babies, we would probably because we did find out, I think like cute things, right? And now even dogs, like, because you always kind of like, I think when there's like a dog in the room, you are someone who would go and go first, the dog. And I wasn't really before, but now I would. So I could totally see if we were like at someone's barbecue or whatever, we would both and someone had a baby or someone had a dog, we probably would be the two girls and then be like, Oh, my gosh, Janet gave such a wholesome response. But I agree. It's the high. I think the environment really matters. Yeah. Yeah. Hello everyone, Helen here. And this one is for all the parents out there who have babies that are still in their diapers. If you're a parent, I will be shocked if you haven't experienced a nasty, outrageously unnecessary blowout just yet. We used to experience them and they were never a good time, but now with the new and improved Pampers Swadler's diaper with blowout barrier innovation, Swadler's prevents up to a hundred percent of leaks, even blowouts. This diaper has a blowout barrier at the back waist to prevent those messy leaks and blowouts plus dual leak guard barriers at the legs to help protect leaks where they happen most often. Pampers Swadler's are dermatologists approved by the skin health Alliance, hypoallergenic and free of parabens and latex. Yes, we only want the best for our babies. They're available in sizes newborn to size eight and now feature designs with new animal characters, Shiloh the elephant and Freddy the duck. How cute for trusted protection, Trust Pampers, the number one pediatrician recommended brand. The last time was in Oregon. It was back in 2014 for David Choi's tour with one of my really good friends, Justin. It was just a quick stop, but it left me wanting more since we were only there for a day. So as you all know, I recently have been enjoying spending more time outside and being more active. Justin was just commenting on how we should go on a trip together and find a destination that would be ideal for this new lifestyle. He's always been an active person. So without a doubt, Oregon is on our list. Something I'm considering to get the most out of this trip is booking a guide.

What are some moments that if you were to reflect on really were key moments in our friendship or has solidified our connection today? Okay. I'm going to brace myself. When I was preparing yesterday, I got actually really emotional. And then this makes me more. Okay. I'll start level one. I think one thing that made me feel connected to Janet or I feel like kind of led us forward was when I was actually wanting to work at your company and Janet made such a good effort of putting my resume in a couple of times. And like, she just like, and I didn't know her that well then, but the fact that she's more than willing to help me like maybe transfer jobs or companies, I was like, wow, this girl is like so nice and really kind. So I think that was like another layer of like, we're connecting. My next example would be I didn't, I forgot this happened, but it was right before my breakup in my last relationship. And we had a really bad fight. And it was in that fight that I realized we were not meant to be together. And it was like, kind of like eyeopening and kind of like shocked me. And it was a little, I won't go into details, but it traumatized me a little bit in that moment because of the things that happened. And afterwards I was walking outside my ex-boyfriend's house and I was like in jambles and I didn't know what to do with myself. And the first person I called was Janet. And I was like, I didn't know. I think I was just like bawling because I was like, I'm so lost. I'm so confused. And then she really validated my feelings. She goes, you don't, you don't need to be in this. You don't deserve that, blah, blah, blah. And like, it's okay to feel what you feel. You always validate how I feel. And as a feeler, that is so incredible. So it was that moment. Because like, especially when you're going through a breakup, you're like, I feel so shitty, but like having someone to call on. And I didn't, I forgot you were first person. I think, I do remember like, I think our close-ins started developing more on the professional side when we were like giving like career advice. And then I think that kind of opens up into bigger like life topics. Oh, what do you want to do? And you were someone, we were both people who were quite passionate about our careers. So once we connect on that level, then it also, it's like the dating and then your relationship. And then within the relationship, I think we do talk about emotions and then about your emotions also kind of, you know, deal with like mental health as well. It just, it did get deeper and more comfortable. So I think I feel like I remember us talking about your relationship and stuff before that event. So probably when that happened, you were like, oh, she already understands. She knows. Yeah. Oh, sorry. It comes back for me. There's another, there's two more moments. I forgot. Let me think. I think you brought it up earlier and then I'll touch on one more. That's like, goes all the way home for our connection. But I think you mentioned earlier how like, I think we, we tend to rely on each other a lot when things get really tough with work. I think you mentioned when Helen was on maternity leave, I think it's really hard in general to run a company up with three people. Like I think we, we do a good job of balancing out, but it is difficult at times. So when one of our key members is gone, which we totally understand, I think we had a really buckle down to be like, we had, we got to hold it, hold down the fort and have a team that's relying on us that I think that's when I'm like, oh, Janet's like really reliable. And like, I could count on you for things because it was tough. Like I was just, we want to sugar coat it. It was tough. So there was that moment. And the last moment I will share, and I think you may have similar answer for me, but like, sorry. I don't know why I'm getting so emotional. They are like major. Okay. Sorry. It was during my panic attack during our retreat. Sorry. No, you're good. Yeah. So I don't think I shared it publicly, but like I started going to therapy because I had a panic attack at my corporate job and it was manageable, but it came back so strong during one of our retreats and it really, really helped me. And I think it was like, I think during one of our retreats and it really freaked me out because I never had a panic attack to that level. And I literally felt like I was, I couldn't breathe and I didn't know what to do. And I, and I didn't want to burden you both because we're there on our time to like build the next chapter of ABG. And I looked at you and I was like, I don't know what to do. And you go, what do you need? And I go, I need to go home. And you literally packed everything up and we picked up how like she was on the beach or doing something. You drove me home and I felt like so protected because I felt like, it's like hard to explain sometimes a panic attack to someone who's never experienced it. And I didn't know, like, like I just felt kind of lost. And I felt very like, I remember you driving me home. I was telling you, I was like, I cannot breathe right now. And I can't talk. I can't do anything. And I remember walking through my doors to my apartment and I just like fell to the ground, like bawling because I could finally breathe. And I didn't even know why I felt so like how the panic attack came on. But I just remember being in that moment, being like, Janet, like really is here for me and really gets me. Sorry. I just, I don't revisit this moment a lot because it really was scary for me. And even after that moment, I couldn't even go to our meetings without feeling scared. Yeah. Yeah. But yeah, that was, that was, that was the moment I always think about too. Oh, thank you for, I know it's like hard to go back there. But yeah, I know, I think for me personally, like I've had friends have panic attacks and I haven't been there with them, but I heard them describe it. So it's like, I know what I kind of understand what's happening right now. And so like, and I know it's very scary because you probably don't like, you didn't have like any previous understanding of that, right? It wasn't as like bad as that time. Yeah. Yeah. And the thing that was interesting was like almost, I think exactly a year later I had, I don't know if you call it a panic or anxiety attack. There was like some specific in terms, but we were on zoom and it was with Helen and Mel and myself and I was in our apartment. I think this was during a time where, I don't know, I think it's just like, when we say that, you know, like starting a business with your friends is challenging. But then also like doing it during a pandemic. And then we are going through transitions of like Helen going on maternity leave and sometimes like I could just spiral in terms of like all the questions. Like I start not only thinking about the work, but then it's like, Oh my God, finances and like, like the rest of my life and like all this stuff. And I think I was also dating someone at the time and like it wasn't really clear yet. We were like still going through the like, what are we? And I was like, I had just one of those days where I was like spiraling and for some reason, and mine manifested very differently than Mel's. Mel's yours was like big emotions, right? Mine was like nothing, but inside my head was just like swirling. Like I couldn't control my thoughts. I remember just feeling like really, like really intense brain fog. And I was like, I think I'm going to just like sit down and it should pass in like five minutes. It didn't pass. And then we had an ABG meeting and I was like kind of muscling through it. And then we had like an hour break for lunch and we were going to meet up again on zoom. During that hour break, I was like, come on, you got like, what's going on? You can just like maybe eat some food, maybe like lie down, take a nap. Still didn't go. We logged back in. And I think I just remember looking at you to me like, I don't know what's happening right now, but like I can't get a grasp of reality. And I don't, and Mel literally, I remember seeing in the zoom, she jumps to the screen. She's like, Janet, I think you're like, what's happening. I think I know what's happening to you. It's a thing that I went through like last year, like look at me. It's okay. And you kind of like helped like anchor me and you're like, don't worry. And I was kind of like, you're like, what's going on in your mind right now? It's like this and that you're like, stop, it's okay. And you like anchored me. And then even after we got off that, like the meeting, we got through the work. I remember you called me and we just had a conversation and it was like, because once again, you understood, even though we have, you had like, we have a different experience of it. You understood kind of what it is to feel like you don't have control of what's happening to you physically or mentally or something. Right. So yeah, I feel like that is something that definitely like connects us. And when you go through something that vulnerable and someone is there for you, like that's like a, it's a very strong bond that you develop. Yeah. Oh my God, I forgot about that. Sorry, we went through that. But yeah, I think when it comes to anxiety or like all this stuff, we always, we understand, we get it. Yeah. Oh, fuck. I'm like shit now.

Next question we're going to explore is something about the other person that you really appreciate that maybe you haven't told them before. I feel like I told you everything. I know. Okay, maybe they're not telling. Just like we'll share things that we appreciate about each other. I feel like last, I mean, I said a lot in the episode. I think I do appreciate that you're like the big sister I never had because I've always wanted a big sister, but you truly are a big sister to me. I love how nurturing you are. And I feel like when you're someone I can always count on, let's say like one day I'm feeling lonely or want to do something. Jan, I'll always say yes. You're always down. Yeah, yeah. I am always down. And I love that Mel is someone who will have the ideas to want to do something and call me up to do that. And I'm working, we're working on like, I'm like, I'm working on trying to be more proactive and stuff, but I love that you demonstrate that so well as someone who's just like, if you feel like you want to get something done or you want to get out, like you're very proactive about figuring out something to do and go and go do it. And that is the thing that I like about you too, is just socially you have this like bubbly energy about you. And that can be so like necessary in not only like socially, but also in our work setting, you know, like during meetings, I feel like I can always rely on you to like either drive it or to like when you get really passionate about something, your energy is infectious. And so I love, I really, really do love that. A kind of a random thing. I love when you speak like Chinglish randomly. What? Chinglish will be like at a restaurant and then she'll like randomly say something in Mandarin because she knows I understand. But like she'll mix it with English. So what's an example? I go, Oh my God, can I get some, uh, uh, shit. Hi. Oh, I just said, Oh, can I get a sibei bingsui? Yeah, or sibei ice water. You mix it like that. Or like when we were at the cafe for lunch the other day, you were like, you're like eating the tuna and you're like, Oh, this is a Leo out of 10. Like it's six out of 10. Right. She says it so that the people like can't understand that. Then we do a little shit. There are some of them just like, I could, I could slip a little, like this is on my mind, but I'll say that loud to you because you understand what I'm saying. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's kind of like a secret language for, yeah. I actually like, I know I plan a lot of stuff, Jay, but I don't think you realize how much you always come out though. Like you don't really say no. Like there are actually a lot of moments in like when you lived in downtown, I was looking through my old stories. We would just go out, just me and you. Yeah. And I was like, all right, like cool. And we have so much fun. Yeah. Or she had like time. She would be like, I'm going to come to your apartment to chill a bit before the meeting or after the meeting or something. So yeah, that's true. Well, to wrap up today's episode and to depart from the emotions, I thought it'd be fun to kind of maybe like share with the shared that listeners, like, what is something weird about the other person that you've noticed or you haven't really shared out loud or shared with me? What is something unique or weird? I don't think it's weird. I just think it's really interesting how into horoscopes Janet is. I'm into horoscopes. Like I check it every morning, but like you like watch hour long videos of it. So I think that's like a little interesting. The other thing is like, I do find your interest in certain men to be. Oh, that's, I think Eugene's, Eugene's a very attractive man, but I'm talking about as Janet finds Abe Abraham Lincoln hot. I don't really, honest Abe character is sexy. So it's not a physical thing. I mean, it also, he was, I don't know if this is true, but he was known as like the tall, dark and handsome type. Right? Like, I don't know. Everyone pull out your penny and let me know what you think. He's on the penny, right? He is on the penny. Sure. I don't know. That is, that's totally fair. Yeah. The, the artist men are, are quite different. We don't ever have Oprah. We don't ever have overlapping. Like never. Something I was going to say about Mel, which I don't know if we've already shared this in a previous episode, but you have this like red Spider-Man PJs. I love my Spider-Man shirt. But you have just like, Mel has like small unique things like that, that I don't know, that are just like very Mel. What else is a very Mel thing? I do think like when we go on to like overnight trips, everyone has like normal pajamas. Mine's not, mine's always a little like, she has the red, the red Spider-Man because it's like a really comfortable to you, but it was like a random tee you got at like a, I don't know, it was like a merch item at a movie premiere. And then you also have like fuzzy, like hot pink, like PJ pants. Oh, my Hello Kitty pants. Yeah. I have very interesting pieces. Yeah. I mean, that's very unique. The other thing that I find interesting, you're always very aware of if you smell or not. Oh yeah. She always points at it. She's like, I might smell right now. Or like, do I have deodorant? I think that's actually one of my most common phrases is like, I think I need deodorant. Yeah. I don't know what happened, man. I just, once I hit 30, my stink level just went up. I was five. I don't know. Well, this was a really great conversation. It truly was. I mean, I feel like we laughed and we were able to like cry and like remember memories. Thank you for joining us on this conversation. We're going to have two more of these where Mel speaks with Helen and Helen and I will have a conversation as well. And we really want to encourage you all out there to have sit down conversations with friends. You know, I think for like friendships like ours, where we see each other so often, it's really easy to take for granted and not sit back and like reflect on like the things that you find unique about each other, the things that you find interesting. I don't know. We're like, what was a moment that, you know, like, um, that you supported each other? So we encourage you to have these conversations. Um, and what is something that people can leave in the comments for us? What is something you truly value in your friendships that, and then maybe also like, what is like something that's kind of weird about one of your favorite friends, but good weird, not like good, like unique, like something that other people don't like. Yeah. It's like a little quirk. That's just special to them. And with that, we'll catch you on the next episode. Bye.
