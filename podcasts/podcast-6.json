It was very apparent that I was a fob. For those who don't understand, it's fresh off the boat. It's someone who literally just came to America from overseas. When you don't do those things for your parents or your family, when you don't put your family first, you then feel, I mean, I felt like a bad daughter. I felt like I was disappointing them. I knew what I could do to make them happy, but am I going to prioritize their happiness or am I going to try to prioritize mine? Welcome to Voice Hugs, a podcast on becoming your best self and embracing all seasons of life with open arms. This is your host, Viv and Ro. Hello. Hello. Hello. I have a story to tell and it was actually a very, very sweet moment. I wrote it in my journal as like a really special thing that happened last month. So last, a few weeks ago, actually, I was walking Charlie at a farmer's market after work. Usually when I take Charlie on walks, I'm stopped often because people want to know like, oh, can I pet your dog? What kind of breed is he? Oh my God, what's his name? So as I'm walking through this farmer's market, I sense that someone is following me. So I actually start walking a little bit faster because I was like, oh, I don't want to stop. But then I really sense that this person's following me. So I just do a complete stop and I turn around and there's this like young girl. She came up to me and I thought she was going to say, hey, like what kind of dog do you have? You know, he's so cute. And she goes, are you Viv from Voice Hugs? And I was like, her jaw just dropped on video. Oh yeah, sorry. My jaw just dropped and I just looked at her and I was like, oh my God, yes. This was the first time ever being stopped because of Voice Hugs. And I was just like in shock. So she was like, hey, I've been like listening to Voice Hugs and I'm like a huge fan. And I was like, oh my God, this is so special. And she asked to take a photo and I was like, no, I want a photo with you. I was like, can you send me that photo afterwards? Like it was just so special. I went back to the farmer's market a week or two later because she was working one of the booths and she wrote both of us a handmade card and I'll show a little B roll of that. It was super sweet and I just couldn't believe it. And I ended up following her on Instagram and I'm going to get a coffee with her in a few weeks. That is so sweet. I actually haven't seen the letter yet because I moved home and immediately came to Asia and Viv and I didn't get to see each other. There's a very different feeling of like meeting someone in person in real life based on them hearing your stories on a podcast, which is so intimate. If I was just someone who posted a lot of pretty photos on Instagram, I'd be like, oh cool, you like my aesthetic eye or something like that. You like my style. But then I think for someone to recognize me and also recognize me because of my voice, she heard me call Charlie and she was like, oh my God, that's Vivian. Like I recognize her voice. It was like just so special. I think like that's partly why I wanted to like continue the relationship and like actually meet her and get to know her because that's what we wanted or that's at least like what I really wanted out of this like connection and stuff. And so to be able to do that was just so special. Connection and community. Yeah. I'm very curious what you wrote in your journal that day or like with this event, this little event. I had a full therapy session about this as well and I actually cried because it was like so sweet to me. And I mean, now I feel like when this listener hears this, she's gonna be like, what? You cried. But back to what I was saying about like someone listening to your stories and like on a podcast, I feel like this is more of like who I am as a person, you know, especially in the context of our relationship, our friendship is very real and very true in my life. And so the conversations that come out of it, it is very Vivian. And so for someone to see that and see me and make me feel seen and heard and understood, which is what we were trying to do for our listeners on the podcast, it was almost like this switch moment where in her card to me, she wrote about like all these instances or like stories that were shared throughout multiple episodes. And so it's like, wow, I felt like understood and seen by her. And so it was just so sweet and special because of that. When we first started Voice Hugs, I think a few of our pillars included connect for sure connection was a huge one and community was like an offspring to that, you know, like creating this sense of belonging and understanding. And so to be able to experience that in real life, quite honestly, we're always just talking to our computer like we haven't even really recorded in real life. Exactly. Like 90% of the time I'm in a closet that's like tiny. And so it feels very, not lonely, but like, it's a very individual process and I don't get to engage as much. And so being able to do that with this listener, she's really special. She actually submitted a question for us, an episode topic idea. And so we're going to dedicate this episode to this listener's topic slash question, which is, how does your ethnicity and culture impact your life today? I feel like this is very timely because of the connection and the community where, yeah, I think a huge part of our ethnicity is about community. Yeah. And I think, you know, like how we identify ourselves when it comes to ethnicity and culture, we actually haven't really talked about that at all on Voice Hugs. So I think it'll be a fun new topic to chat about and hear about our similarities and differences of being Asian American. And then even just like within the subcultures of like our ethnicity or like how our families came to America and the different impacts and influences that resulted in who we are today. This reminds me of, do you remember like maybe five years ago, where growing up Asian American was a huge thing on YouTube? Where like Jenim and then Wiley, Sophie, like all the Asian American creators had a dedicated video on it. I don't know. My story's just a bit different. So I was like, yeah, I don't want to create a video dedicated on how I'm Asian American and like sound like I'm bragging. Anyway, you guys want to know what my story is?

I actually think there's a lot of benefits to sharing like different stories because I guess we'll start kind of from the beginning. So we'll give some background and then I'll share a little bit more about like my realizations with my experiences versus someone like you who had a very different upbringing than myself. So to start off, what is your ethnicity slash tell us a little bit about your upbringing and your background? Okay well I'm Taiwanese American. I was born in the states and I spent my youth in America until maybe until I was like four or five years old. I moved back to Taiwan from I think pre-k to third grade and then moved back to the states in fourth grade. So I always joke that my English isn't good and my Chinese also isn't really that good because I miss both formative years. Like when you're learning grammar in grade school like from first grade to third grade I wasn't here. I also left Taiwan when I was third grade so my Chinese also isn't that great. So that was the bullet points of my youth. What about you? Quick bullet points. Okay so I always struggle when someone asks me like what ethnicity I am because I think my last name is Vietnamese but my family is like Chinese, born in Vietnam. So my grandparents had left China because of the communist war then and all left to different like Asian countries. So my grandfather went to Vietnam and had my mom there and same thing happened with like my dad's side as well. And so like culturally I think I definitely have a lot of Vietnamese influence but I can't say that I'm like Vietnamese either and then when it comes to like being Chinese I don't really know anything about China or like the culture of that either. I feel like mine is just a blended unique group of like Chinese Vietnamese people who I've actually met a few people who are like have a similar background as me in Southern California as well. Like a lot of parents are Chinese, they speak Chinese. My mom speaks like five different languages but she's like not Vietnamese though she was born there. So that's my ethnicity and then when it comes to like how my family came to the States that was because of another war. So definitely I think like that experience of why they came here has influenced a lot of the mindsets that have been ingrained in me over the years. Yeah I think just any immigrates during wartime there's like probably a lot of trauma or like scarcity mindset that gets brought a lot of people together and then they're like, oh my god, I'm so upset. That gets brought along with them and passed on to the next generation. I was born in Southern California and I actually grew up in a predominantly Caucasian neighborhood. I didn't really have Asian friends until high school and for sure in college I was like the first African was I thought all Asians in America came because of war. It was like so foreign to me to meet people in college like yourself where I was like oh like you can have parents who came here for school or like came here for college or they were already here. It was just so foreign to me and so that was really when I started understanding more about how my experience to me and that being Asian American is not necessarily the same thing for everyone which I think goes back to what I was sharing about your story of how you know whatever content was put out at the time. I think it's helpful to hear about how differences come up in like your experience as well because it exposed me at least to just other ways of being that I shouldn't assume just because you're Asian you're like me you know like we're all different and I'm projecting my experience onto someone else just because they like physically look like me. This difference isn't something that's like bad or whatever it's just things to be aware of or like new perspectives different experiences. Yeah not to like assume someone understands you either right it's like oh we're Asian so we get each other like that's not necessarily the case and if anything I think that makes it you take another step to truly get to know someone as a person and ask questions where you get to know them not just making these assumptions because of how someone looks. It's very deep what you just said can be applied to all facets of life. Yeah and I think that's also why we probably didn't talk about being Asian like that wasn't like at the forefront of my mind when it came to voice hugs and creating episodes because I want to say that I just see it more as like we're all just people and yes if you have like a common identifier maybe you share more similar experiences but like for me at least getting to know someone has more to do with like asking them about their story and being Asian can be a part of it even like with you it's like well how did you you know go from here to there like how did you feel being split between two very different cultures at such a young age and that's like more of what I'm curious about rather than oh she's Asian. Mm-hmm well to answer your question so with my family's immigration story this is like super front of mine because I was just talking to all my cousins about it recently it was during I think it was after World War II where like during or after there was a U.S. base in Taiwan. I actually just heard this story a few weeks ago my grandpa being like the loving caring super compassionate big-hearted man that he is my grandparents didn't have a lot of money growing up like my parents my mom definitely didn't have much money growing up so like money was already an issue and my grandpa still chose to save like a chunk of money to give to his little sister so that she can learn English and then maybe have a better life to the point where my grandma would be like hello we have five kids to feed like I think there would be some like disagreements or arguments that will happen but because my grandpa's little sister was able to learn English she was able to work at this like English club I think it's called like the American something like ACC or something that I think still exists till this day in Taiwan and she was able to meet an American soldier and they fell in love he moved her to the states and I think back then this is like I don't know like mid-1950s 60s where if you have a family member that's a U.S. citizen you can bring over other family members so my grandpa sister brought over my grandpa and then my grandpa brought over the rest of the family so like I don't think it was necessarily war and I actually should have probably asked my mom what the real reason was I think maybe it's just more opportunities a different life perhaps like a better life that's what kind of got them to move over and when I was talking to my cousins about this there's like 10 of us if you think of the fact that had my grandpa not gone out of his way to provide for his little sister then she would never have met her husband and then our whole family would be here living a much different life under much different circumstances that is wild and yeah I think there's just also like a little small tangent something about traveling I just love watching people especially in Japan kind of like going about their day-to-day lives or commutes seeing what they're like what they eat what they're doing how they commute whatever because it gives me so much perspective like I wonder what my life would have been like if I grew up here versus Taiwan or versus America versus like other like any other country that's my mom's immigration story my dad just tagged along to kind of go back to your initial question too of what it was like growing up in two different places I think it helped me to at a very early age see that there's different cultures and I think because I spent a good chunk of my time in Taiwan I saw what it was like being Asian Asian and so when I was in the States instead of being like one or the other it was easier to kind of understand that this is how people did things here versus there is not to say one is right or wrong it's just different like the culture is different and I think it also helped that I grew up with a bunch of cousins or the same as me and also I grew up in a city going through the school system that was also predominantly Asian so I think that also kind of helped like the word like the word is like Asian-ness I was never really aware of my Asian-ness because yeah because I think I just had so much experience and exposure to my culture like I actually lived in Taiwan I lived the life did the thing spoke the language I think I was more fluent in Chinese than I was in English when I was younger so

to me because I was like so aware of my Asian-ness like I felt like such an outcast until high school and then even in high school I still wasn't aware that like oh there are different types of Asians with different family histories and different backgrounds and so I don't know if that's why I mean I guess a lot of my friends now are Asian but I definitely felt a sense of belonging after I started meeting more Asian people what you were saying earlier about how like even though you were in Asia Asia and also here where you are surrounded by Asians like I'm curious culturally how does that influence like who you are today because I think for me I was so aware of the Eastern culture of like putting your family first your community you know like respecting your elders and just being polite and kind of obedient versus like what you see on tv with like Western culture of like it's very much about you and your needs and like you can throw tantrums and um whoa what's that I would be beat I remember one time my mom was like you need to stop watching Lizzie McGuire because this is a bad influence on you and in my mind I'm like this is just a normal show yeah so I'm like curious what that was like for you because you are actually surrounded by Asians but culturally like you're probably able to feel it as well I think there's so many layers this is this topic is so nuanced I I'll start from more of like the like me as a person coming to America at the tender age of fourth grade don't know how old I was 10 it was very apparent that I was a fob for those who don't understand it's fresh off the boat and someone who literally just came to America from overseas like in the grand scheme of things it didn't really bother me because the reason why I was different I knew why I was different it was because I was living another life so it was normal for me to not to feel like a little different or to maybe not be as fluent in the language so like I had to go to ESL English as second language for kids to like pick up on their English skills um I you know went through the transition of not having friends and slowly making different groups of friends and eventually finding my group of friends and all of that and I think this is like a very normal and universal feeling that I think a lot of Asians in America go through is there comes a point where it's like I just want to be like because I'm in America I just want to be like a little white girl you know like the way that I dress the way that I talk the things that I eat and I think like my food preference is probably the most apparent thing where because I grew up eating I don't know Asian food all the time you know like in college it's like what do you want to eat where do you want to go like on dates you know whatever with my significant other at the time it was I was like oh I want like American food I want Italian food I want non-Asian food because Asian food just didn't appeal to me until like my middle school friends and I didn't really like it until like my mid to late 20s but I think if it's like about me and like culture and the person that I want to be that I think yeah at an earlier age in elementary school middle school college maybe not as much anymore but like there's a part of me that's like I want to be American and there comes a point and I think all of our lives where you start feeling like I'm not for as American as I try to be I'm not fully American and for as Asian as I try to be I'm not fully Asian because I can't fully speak the language my language skill is capped at a third grade level so what am I you're kind of left in this in between zone of you feel like you're in between cultures so I think that's kind of where I was at maybe like college when I was just enough to think about these things and to realize these things and I think it was just a feeling that I had that I was aware of it didn't make me want to do anything it didn't make me feel less than it didn't there weren't any real feelings attached to which is like oh this is interesting like where is my sense of belonging and I think the reason why maybe I was able to see this and not feel like maybe I had anything to prove or maybe feel like I need to figure it out ASAP was going back to like another layer of you know for as much as I grew up in Asia where the school system is rigorous like people talk about tiger parents here in America I don't even know what tiger moms are called in Asia because they're all like school is the only thing that matters which is why I think I'm so so so lucky where my parents just wanted me to be a good person so they never put that pressure on me to be like a certain way and we actually just talked about it recently when we're here on this trip where my parents are just joking they're like you know yeah we weren't straight-A students so how could we expect you and your brother to be straight-A students so I think because of their more chill parenting like for the record my mom is not chill but when it comes to academics she's very chill so I think because of their more chill like parenting style when it comes to education it allowed me to explore things a bit more and allowed me to dream a little bigger yeah it sounds like from your experience whether like you're Asian like culturally right like the influence that you had and also maybe even the culture within your family there's just never this sense of like pressure to be put in a box or to like have to do things a certain way it was more like okay this is what it is and there was this space that you were given to then figure that out for yourself like understand it on your own rather than someone saying like oh you're too Asian or you're not Asian or you're a fob or like whatever that was it was just like hey I am these things this is what's happening and I have the freedom to kind of explore some of that and dream bigger and that makes a lot of sense how you ended up in the career path and like the place that you are now yeah yeah and I feel like something you said just right now really resonated where it's like my parents kind of just gave me space to explore while also telling me and helping me understand that it's important for me to know my own cultural heritage so they let me do things they let me explore but they also help me understand that because you are ethnically Chinese Taiwanese whatever that these are all the things that you I don't know just like to still remember where you come from and that it's a thing to be proud of rather than something to be I don't know anything other than proud or like maybe ashamed or something that maybe you need to hide because I'm pretty sure there are moments where I'm like oh my god why am I so Asian and you're missing it and I'm like I just want to be more American and you want to do what other kids are doing and they just would talk to me like an adult they're like hey you know this is great you're in America it's normal for you to feel this way and that's fine you can do that but we just want you to remember also that you know here's all like the beautiful lineage and culture that you come from.

I kind of wish my parents did more of that with me because I feel very disconnected. The influence that my ethnicity has had on me feels more like a reaction rather than an intentional rather than an understanding of like where I come from. So Viv would love to hear from your perspective what it was like growing up in sunny southern California in a predominantly Caucasian neighborhood. I was not proud of being Asian. I like wanted to fit in so badly and I like hated my hair. My hair was like slick straight. I hated my hair. I hated my eyes. Everything. I just wanted this American life of you know like and I think especially for me too I grew up in a house with 10 other people so it wasn't like I had a dad that went to work or like a stay at home mom who's part of the PTA and would come help in the classroom. Like this is kind of the dream that I wanted. I don't think that has to do with like being Asian or not Asian but I think at that young of an age when you don't understand yourself in the context of the world and like your family's like history and their background as much as you do now as an adult I just felt very outcasted. Did other people actually like physically outcast me because I was Asian? I don't think so. I think it was more like an internal feeling of recognizing like oh there are differences here. There's differences in what we eat in how your you know like I remember my friends had chores or like allowances. I was like what are those? Like I don't have that and I just had to like focus on studying. Like I had to get good grades and I think that was kind of that's like what I mean by everything felt more like a reaction than an understanding of where I came from and it wasn't until I started meeting other people who had similar experiences. So once I went to high school and college you just meet so many more people that are no longer in that neighborhood or like that area that you grew up in and that was more so when I started feeling proud. Not necessarily proud of where I came from but like I started to appreciate my unique experience in comparison to like how I felt of it when I was younger. Like wow it's actually really cool that I eat Asian food. I like use chopsticks. I remember feeling ashamed that like I was like I want to eat with a fork. I don't want to eat with chopsticks but like it's actually really cool that I can do both you know or that I'm exposed to other cultures in a different way than someone who I don't know maybe they're like fourth gen or like fifth gen in generation in America and so part of that experience for me was I had to learn how my family's influence on me like not family but like their ethnicity and like where we came from. How did that impact the way that I'm living my life? I mentioned earlier that my parents came because of the war and so because scarcity mindset was like such a big thing I grew up just valuing security and stability and so very differently from you like my parents pushed this idea of you need to find a stable and secure job. Like you need to find a career path that's safe and so I studied accounting in college right like such a safe path for you. You won't get fired. I mean you won't lose your job. Everyone needs an accountant and so like even my job today right like I work in the government and it's a very safe secure job and dreaming big taking risk is not something that I'm very used to. That's probably like one way that my background has like influenced who I am today but at the same time I think what's really great about all of this is that eventually you get to a point where you recognize like your patterns and you recognize your opportunities or your privilege or like the experience that you had and you see how it has impacted and influenced who you are as a person but you then have that choice to continue that or to shift it. So for example what I was sharing earlier about the fear of taking risks and valuing stability and security now that I'm aware of how that has impacted my life decisions up until this point I have a choice to either continue that because I like it. It feels safe. It feels comfortable or I can start questioning like do I want to continue down that path? Like do I want this influence to still impact the way that I choose to go about like living life right? And I think for me it was just learning how to take baby steps to become a little bit more true to who you are each year. Was I going to like quit my job and pursue something completely differently? Voice hugs, full time! Yeah like a lot of that still is ingrained in me you know that that fear like the family values like everything that has been passed down is still very much a part of me but all it is at the end is to be aware of what your experience has been like and what you want to do with that information. I feel like something we've been talking about a lot when it comes to I would say most Asian families and I think like your upbringing too you've shared that it's very community oriented, family oriented, the values all of that is about each other and also maybe even like making each other happy, making each other you know whatever because you're living together because they're your parents versus the Lizzie McGuire style of very like independent individually minded. Where do you see yourself now and how do you find yourself navigating kind of I don't know like where are you on the spectrum and are you happy with where you are? That was really hard for me because I think making my parents happy and proud is like such a huge thing growing up it's like that quote from Mulan like bring honor to your family you know and so a lot of that was like I need to do all these things to make mom and dad proud and to make mom happy and at one point probably in my mid-20s was when I realized all of the decisions that I have been making up to this point was to make mom and dad happy and I myself am so unhappy so I think for me I kind of swung to the other side of the pendulum instead of taking these baby steps to be more true to myself I kind of almost avoided my family altogether I was like no I'm not gonna let this influence me anymore I'm going to do my own thing I'm gonna move out and I'm gonna just focus on myself and I think with that there's a lot of guilt that comes up and I'm sure this is also very relevant for Asian-American families too where when you don't do those things for your parents or your family when you don't put your family first you then feel I mean I felt like a bad daughter I felt like I was disappointing them I knew what I could do to make them happy but am I going to prioritize their happiness or am I going to try to prioritize mine as selfish as that felt yeah part of my journey though was realizing that you can't really be there for someone or love someone if you don't love yourself and if you don't take care of yourself and so this idea of sacrificial love which I saw between my mom and her mom and just different people in my different members of my family I know that's ingrained in me but I don't want to pass that down either like I don't want my kids to think that they have to make me happy and that that's the role I want to play as their parent to take care of myself and show them that they can also take care of themselves so I'm in an interesting place in like my family's like generation history whatever I'm trying to say because I'm kind of trying to break some of it part of it is just that like we're in a different country now you know like you're not surrounded by the culture that is within another Asian country's culture so yeah but it's definitely a struggle feeling selfish versus like you know family's all about like giving and there's almost like no boundaries sometimes with families and learning how do I put up how do I say no to my mom how do I not be there you know how do I choose myself and not break that relationship with my family as well I think the interesting thing and what I found out kind of what we talked about offline before this too was that I'm I can't speak for all of us but I think for us when we kind of go do our own thing maybe like you know the more individualistic path of like trying to figure out who you are what's important to you what you love what you want to love what you want to be proud of all of these things what your culture is how you want to define culture as the interesting thing is I feel like for the most part or at least I'm just gonna speak for myself that because my parents gave me so much space and they would sprinkle preferences here and there like it would be nice if you know it would be nice especially like with like partners right I remember they mentioned in passing when I was in college like it would be nice if who you ultimately end up marrying could speak Chinese so that we can communicate with them and instead of it being like I want to do this because my parents want to do it like when they first told me that I was like whatever like I'm marrying them like this is my relationship with my husband I'm gonna marry whoever I want this is in college and I think as I got out of college as I started reconnecting with myself with spirituality with what's important to me I think I ended up coming back to the same conclusion where I was like okay I love my parents I love the relationship I have with my parents and I will love to have one of the three criteria's of what I want in a future husband to be that they can share in that relationship with them and share it in that language and so even though it may seem in the moment that we are doing something that's more selfish I think if we're very conscious and intentional about why we're doing it it will ultimately lead us to where we need to be anyway but I think that just kind of shows the way but I think that journey of choosing for ourselves of where we want to go on this journey and what bucket or what label we want to put ourselves under or if we even want to label ourselves maybe why do we need to label ourselves I think that's something that I realized of like why do I need to be Asian or why do I need to be American why can't I just be me just be Rowena who you know straddles both of these ethnicities and both of these identities and maybe that is my identity to be in the middle or to I don't know to create something beautiful you're one of like my few friends I think like Asian American friends who later on in your life decided to connect with your roots I think I don't see that as much with maybe some of my other friendships and I wonder if it's because you had that space and that like openness and you were exposed to literally a whole other country at such a young age that it's more so a part of you than having never been to Asia and just being born Asian in America yeah so I think that's really special and that's cool and I feel like that would make your parents so happy too and yourself like you are happy too with that decision so with what we were sharing about towards the end of the episode I think guilt and shame is another great episode topic to talk about maybe even in the context of like family because where does that guilt or shame come from is it your shame or is it shame that has been passed down and put onto you which I don't know I feel like there's a lot there that I would be curious to explore as well in a future episode this is such a loaded I mean not loaded but this was such a huge question you know like and it was so broad so if there is something specific that you guys would like to hear within the context of ethnicity and culture or maybe something even more specific about how that influences our lives please let us know you can always email us hello at voice hugs podcast.com or you can shoot us a dm at voice hugs podcast thank you again to my very special friend who stopped me at the farmer's market I can't wait to get coffee with you and anyone else who I meet in the future side note I felt like we were friends I even told her where I lived and I was like oh shoot this is a stranger who I just pointed like I just told her where I lived but I felt like we were friends because of how we connected but yeah I should I should be careful with that not that she is yeah gonna hurt me or anything that's how close I felt to her yeah I think we should we can plan more in-person things around SoCal maybe later on this year yeah I'm getting so I stood up earlier to go tell my dad that we're finishing soon because he was listening to his news stuff and I got so lightheaded oh no it's
